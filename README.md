## How we will work together

1. Master is a main branch
2. For the each new task you should create new branch with name for ex.: LESSON-01
3. For each done task you should do commit with summary for ex.: Task01 is done, then "push origin"
4. When all tasks for the lesson is done, you should create a pull request and add timchukd user as reviewer
5. After code review is done and approve from timchukd merge it to Master branch
