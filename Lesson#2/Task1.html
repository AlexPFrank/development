		<p>The task of this part of the second <del>lesom</del> <ins>lesson</ins> is to get to know how
		to use semantic tags. So, I decided to create some random text to show
		how these tags work. You can see all of them in the current paragrah.
		Thank you for the <dfn>attention</dfn>!! :)</p>
		<p><code>cout << "It's a part of code" << endl;</code></p>
		<p><samp>It's a result of input of the computer program or script</samp></p>
		<p><kbd>It's a name of keys or inputing text by the keyboard</kbd></p>
		<p><var>It's a variable</var></p>
		<p><cite>It's a quote or link on the other material</cite></p>
		<p><address>It's a contact information, which is contained in tag address</address></p>
		<p><q>It's a short quote</q></p>
		<p><blockquote>It's a long quote which is contained in tag blockquote. Tag q and blockquote have 
		an attribute cite, which gets meaning of url to the quoting text.</blockquote></p>
